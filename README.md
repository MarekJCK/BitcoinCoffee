## Additional info about the website

It is a simple static one pager build with gulp task manager. It is fully responsive with good results from google page speed:

It is semantically written in HTML5 and CSS3 with linking to paralelnipolis so I guess it will have good rankings soon. I suggest to think over the text. That is very important for robots which will index the web.

## Known issues
Translate to ENG is done with javascript. It does not have linking so you are not able to send eng version of web.
